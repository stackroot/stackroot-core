# stackroot-core

**Modular frontend architecture for Web3 UI tooling ,  built from the ground up.**  
This is a personal showcase project demonstrating a full-stack Web3 setup with a clean, scalable frontend structure.

## Purpose

`stackroot-core` is not a commercial template ,  it's a demonstration of how I approach modular Web3 architecture with modern tooling. The focus is on developer experience, clarity, and composability.

## Features (Showcase)

- ðŸ’¡ **Next.js 15** â€” Using the App Router and React Server Components
- ðŸŽ¨ **Tailwind CSS v4.1** â€” With tokenized theming and responsive UI
- ðŸ§± **Component-first** â€” Built for reusability and clean code organization
- ðŸ”Œ **Wallet Integration** â€” Wagmi for seamless wallet connection
- ðŸª™ **ERC-20 Token Deployment** â€” UI flow to deploy and mint a custom token
